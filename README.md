attempt at running kano harry potter wand with windows

added gestures.py but not fully functional it does not use gui only terminal and you need to hardcode the mac adress of the wand by replacing the 0's





To start off i bought a Kano harry potter wand, then found out that the whole project was dead. i found out a lot of tools but most work with Linux and i have windows. I found alot of python scripts using various methods. I have been programming in a lot of different languages and python was new for me, also i was not aware of how i would go about doing this. I used chatgpt to mess around and get a few things going i upload these to maybe somehow people can fix things and make something out of it. The code is a python script that uses bleak ; Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices acting as GATT servers. It is designed to provide a asynchronous, cross-platform Python API to connect and communicate with e.g. sensors. It also uses NumPy; NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python., tkinte; Tkinter is a Python binding to the tk gui toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's [de facto standard]/ GUI. Tkinter is included with standard [Linux], [Microsoft Windows] and [macOS] installs of Python.
The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. Tkinter was written by [Steen Lumholt] , pillow ; sinceDigital Image processing means processing the image digitally with the help of a computer. Using image processing we can perform operations like enhancing the image, blurring the image, extracting text from images, and many more operations. There are various ways to process images digitally. Here we will discuss the Pillow module of Python. Python Pillow is built on the top of PIL (Python Image Library) and is considered as the fork for the same as PIL has been discontinued since 2011. Pillow supports many image file formats including BMP, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF. The library encourages adding support for newer formats in the library by creating new file decoders.
